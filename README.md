# Project Overview: Human Resources System
### Duration: April 2024 - June 2024 (2 months)

* This project involved the development of a Human Resources (HR) system, utilizing Agile Scrum methodologies, Microservice Architecture, and Component-Based Development principles.

### Technologies and Tools Used:

> __Frontend__ : Implemented using Next.js and TypeScript to ensure a responsive and dynamic user experience.

> **Backend** : Developed with a combination of MyBatis and JPA for robust data management and seamless database interactions.

### Key Approaches:

> **Agile Scrum**: Facilitated iterative development and continuous feedback, ensuring alignment with stakeholder requirements and timely delivery.

> **Microservice Architecture**: Enabled modularity, scalability, and ease of maintenance by decomposing the system into loosely coupled, independently deployable services.

> **Component-Based Development**: Promoted reusability and efficient management of code through well-defined, encapsulated components.


This collaborative effort resulted in a comprehensive HR system designed to streamline and optimize HR processes.
